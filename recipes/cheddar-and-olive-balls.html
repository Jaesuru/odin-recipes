    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This olive ball recipe is based on one from a famous Virginia colonial tavern.</p>
    <p>I've had much better success with this recipe than the one published in their cookbook.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>18 1/2 ounces extra sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>45 pitted green olives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Allow cheese to sit out until it is at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix together cheese, butter, and paprika in a large bowl using a pastry blender. Gradually mix in flour using the pastry blender, then switch to your hands until dough forms a solid, smooth ball that is crumbly when pulled apart. If dough appears too dry, add more shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>Pinch off a small piece of dough and wrap it around an olive. Roll gently between your palms to smooth dough and seal olive inside. Place onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and olives. Cover olives and place into the refrigerator to firm up, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
